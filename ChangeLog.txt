- Changed tau_factor default value from 1 to 0.5.
- thinknesssmoothing factor 0.6 by default (was 0.0)
- beta cooling rampup time in units of T0
- stellar heating rampup time in units of T0 rather than DT
- physical constants (gravitational constant, kB, atomic mass unit, Planck constant) from LLNL units library which follows the NIST constants and the 2019 redefinition of SI
- OUTPUTDIR is now in output namespace and called outdir
- removed default star, central object needs to be declared as a planet now
- irradiation is now controlled by setting a temperature > 0 in the nbody config rather than the "HeatingStar" flag

- simplify build process and remove FARGO_ARCH, use specific env variables now (see arch.defs)
