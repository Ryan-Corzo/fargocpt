- Changed tau_factor default value from 1 to 0.5.
- thinknesssmoothing factor 0.6 by default (was 0.0)
- beta cooling rampup time in units of T0
- stellar heating rampup time in units of T0 rather than DT
- physical constants (gravitational constant, kB, atomic mass unit, Planck constant) from LLNL units library which follows the NIST constants and the 2019 redefinition of SI
- OUTPUTDIR is now in output namespace and called outdir
- removed default star, central object needs to be declared as a planet now
- irradiation is now controlled by setting a temperature > 0 in the nbody config rather than the "HeatingStar" flag
- backtraces are written to file by default
- simplify build process and remove FARGO_ARCH, use specific env variables now (see arch.defs)
- replaced the default executable to run, now run_fargo starts the simulations and calls bin/fargocpt and handles the parallel config
- restructured the output directory into snapshots and monitor directories. Each snapshot dir contains all information to restart the simulation.
- bigplanet.dat files are now called planet.dat files, now fargocpt output v1.2
- self gravity acceleration can now be written out to the snapshots using `WriteSGAccelRad` and `WriteSGAccelAzi` parameter
- there is a file `info2D.yml` which describes the 2D output variables including their array size and units
- Cooling from the disk surface: the config parameter `CoolingRadiativeLocal` has been replaced by `SurfaceCooling` which can take the value `no|false|off`, `thermal` (the existing mode), or `scurve` (new mode).
