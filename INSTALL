Installation instructions for the FARGO code

Once the archive is decompressed and extracted (this step should be
completed since you are reading this file), go to the 'fargo/src/'
directory. There, issue a 'make' or 'gmake' command and you are done:
an executable file 'fargo' will be built in the 'fargo/'
directory. You can leave it here or put it wherever you find it
appropriate in your PATH (Note : you should use 'make' exclusively on
Mac OS X; on all other platforms you must use 'gmake').

Note that your built will be optimized if you define the environment
variable 'FARGO_ARCH', which, depending on your platform, should be
set to one of these: LINUX, OPTERON, MacIntel, MACOSX (powerpc's
only), etc. (see the src/makefile for a comprehensive list). You can
add your own configuration optimized for your platform following the
examples found in the makefile.

A parallel (MPI) executable is built by issuing:
gmake BUILD=parallel (or make BUILD=parallel)

Note that at runtime, FARGO expects to find a file named
'.source.tar.bz2' in the current working directory. If it does not
find it, a harmless error message is issued.  If it finds it, this
file is copied, for your records, in the output directory. You can use
it to know what was the exact version of FARGO you ran when analyzing
your output. The file '.source.tar.bz2' is produced at build time in
the 'fargo/' directory, therefore it is a good idea to use this
directory as your current working directory.
