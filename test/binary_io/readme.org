#+title: Tests for binary io
#+author: Thomas Rometsch

The gasdens files seem to change after the code is restarted.
The scripts in this folder are used to test for this issue and compare data files.

Run =test.sh N= where N is the output number for which you want to compare the output files.
Probably the only important cases for N are zero and non-zero, i.e. initial conditions vs. some intermediate simulation output.

No difference appears for output number 0.
However small differences in the range of numerical precision appear for N > 0.

The exact procedure is as follows:
1) have a simulations up to some output number N
2) make a copy of =cp gasdensN.dat gasdensN.dat.bak=
3) restart the code with =./fargo path/to/setup.par -r N=
4) compare the new =gasdensN.dat= to the old : =cmp -l gasdensN.dat.bak gasdensN.dat=

Many differences appear.
Using =print_differences.py gasdensN.dat.bak gasdensN.dat= you can check the magnitude of the differences.

The differences for a standard fargo setup after 1 orbit are as follows.
