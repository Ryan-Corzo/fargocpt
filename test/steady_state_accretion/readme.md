# Gas Massflow test

## Goal

Test that a simple steady state accretion disk simulation reproduces a constant mass flow model sufficiently well.

## Work in progress!
Right now, only the `open.yml` setup runs.

## TODO:
use the reflecting_damping.yml setup with 1 cell.
Check data between 20 and 60 au, threshold 3e-4
