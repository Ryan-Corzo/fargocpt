# Cold disk test

A power law disk with an ideal equation of state and no heating and cooling is tested for stability.
Additionally, a small mass planet (Mp/Mstar = 2e-5)

## Physical setup

The physics setup is as follows:
- ideal equation of state
- small mass planet
- no explicit viscosity
- no artificial viscosity, i.e. no shock handling
- no heating from irradiation
- no radiative cooling

## Expected behavior

The expectation is that the disk stays close to the initial condition.

## Reason

Show the unexpected cooling in the presence of spiral arms.
